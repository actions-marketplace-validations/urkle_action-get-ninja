# [The **action-get-ninja** action for downloading and caching ninja binaries](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/action-get-ninja) on the GitHub agents.

Restores from cache, or downloads and caches Ninja.
Works for x64 on Linux/macOS/Windows.

Flowchart of `action-get-ninja`:
  1. If cache hit occurs, ninja is restored from cache in less than 1 second;
  1. If cache miss occurs, the action downloads and installs ninja, then **caches both automatically** with GitHub's [@actions/cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache) APIs;
  1. Adds to PATH the ninja executables;

```yaml
    # - uses: actions/cache@v1  <-----= YOU DO NOT NEED THIS
    #   key: <key>              <-----= YOU DO NOT NEED THIS
    #   path: <path>            <-----= YOU DO NOT NEED THIS

    - name: Get latest ninja
      # Using 'v1' branch, the most recent ninja is installed. (1.10.2)
      uses: urkle/action-get-ninja@v1        âŸ¸ THIS IS THE ONE LINER YOU NEED
          
    # If you need to pin your workflow to specific ninja you can specify the version.
    - name: Get specific version Ninja 0.9.0
      uses: urkle/action-get-ninja@v1
      with:
